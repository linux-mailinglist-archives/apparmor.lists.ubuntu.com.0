It's been working fine on Ubuntu 18.04, and we're working on an upgrade to 22.04, but when we try to apply the same profile and initramfs build method on 22.04 it fails to attachÂ to PID 1 systemd.

This method is no longer recommended, and there may be some revisions to initramfs tooling that is needed.

We now recommend using early policy load in systemd see https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/AppArmorInSystemd


> The method we're using now on 18.04 is essentially exactly what's being described on the wiki, except that, as described in the last bullet of the Troubleshooting section, we first install a stub profile and policy at boot, with the attach_disconnected flag, followed by initial configuration/chef-runs that quickly update that stub profile with the detailed allowlist for the host.

I haven't but it has been years since I tried using the initramfs to apply policy.
