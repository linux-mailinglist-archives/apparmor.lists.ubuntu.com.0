SB_KERNMOUNT does propagate to the superblock if it is newly allocated
via sget_fc(): alloc_super(fc->fs_type, fc->sb_flags, user_ns);

But you misunderstood. "If we did it" means "If efivarfs_pm_notify()
somehow were to allocate a new superblock (which it doesn't) then having
SB_KERNMOUNT raised on the newly allocated superblock would be bug
because the superblock could be reused by userspace mounting efivars.

So removing it is the correct thing in either case. It's just confusing
to anyone maintaining that code thinking that it'd be possible for a
superblock to resurface with SB_KERNMOUNT.

Not what I'm saying. Not having MNT_INTERNAL is paramount to not
deadlocking but by not having it you're not losing anything.

We agree but you just misunderstood. :)
