To be clear, this isn't about a generic LSM needing to update its own
blob (LSM state), it is about the BPF LSM updating the capability
sets.  While we obviously must support a LSM updating its own state,
I'm currently of the opinion that allowing one LSM to update the state
of another LSM is only going to lead to problems.  We wouldn't want to
allow Smack to update AppArmor state, and from my current perspective
allowing the BPF LSM to update the capability state is no different.

It's also important to keep in mind that if we allow one LSM to do
something, we need to allow all LSMs to do something.  If we allow
multiple LSMs to manipulate the capability sets, how do we reconcile
differences in the desired capability state?  Does that resolution
change depending on what LSMs are enabled at build time?  Enabled at
boot?  Similarly, what about custom LSM ordering?

What about those LSMs that use a task's capabilities as an input to an
access control decision?  If those LSMs allow an access based on a
given capability set only to have a LSM later in the ordering modify
that capability set to something which would have resulted in an
access denial, do we risk a security regression?

Our current approach to handling multiple LSMs is that each LSM is
limited to modifying its own state, and I'm pretty confident that we
stick to this model if we have any hope of preserving the sanity of
the LSM layer as a whole.  If you want to modify the capability set
you need to do so within the confines of the capability LSM and/or
modify the other related kernel subsystems (which I'm guessing will
likely necessitate a change in the LSMs, but that avenue is very
unclear if such an option even exists).
