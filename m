For more context, you can find my talk to LSS-NA [1] and the slide [2]. I know they may have been work already in these area, this email mostly aim to put the accent on the feature that are the most needed (in my opinion).

yes this has been experimented with, though I don't know if we will ever get it upstream. We might be able to get a limited form if, we can should there is a single task within the namespace. The problem comes down to pivot_root applies to all tasks within the namespace and walking a switch all tasks (generic case) isn't going to get upstream.

I have been playing with a more limited update a shared variable model, that would allow for a change without having to walk all tasks in an ns within a pivot_root hook.

this can't change, it would break policy, even if we update all policy in the system there is policy being shipping by too many other projects. For better or worse the apparmor rules are based on shell globbing not RE or eRE. There is a potential for exposing a full RE with special syntax. Something like

   ^/foo[1-7]*$

so basically using RE anchoring to indicate the rule is using RE instead of globbing. This of course is just one potential way of expressing this. Suggestions are welcome

yeah the docs need serious work

Therefore, having some sort of conditional statement in the profile could make sense. That can mostly be sugar syntax, however, some conditions may need to be checked on execution, while for other, simple directives (like: `only: apt`) parsed during package build could work.

yep. This is a WIP, I don't know if we will get to where we land better condition statements in 4.0 but probably not, as only prep work has been done so far. With that said the plan is to improve the current conditionals, and also add some kernel run time vars.

yeah, another one we need to get upstream. The question has been exactly what we can get upstream before we make it available more broadly. This should be coming within the next couple kernel releases.

I have talked to the snap team about this some, and locally within our own policy we are going to work towards getting rid of unconfined as a label. Any where it exists today with get replaced with a variable with a name that has the semantic intent. It may get set to unconfined, but it will at least be easier to make changes.

I have some ideas here, but we are going to need to do some testing to find what the major bottle necks are. Profile loads do get serialized on a mutex lock but that should be only held during the insert after all the unpack and verification is done.

It will be interesting to get some actual data on the bottle neck.

thanks, that is going to take awhile to digest. Hopefully there are some good clues in it
